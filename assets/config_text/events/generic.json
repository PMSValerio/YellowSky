Even though the memories are fresh, all of it resembles more of a blur than anything else, with the single exception of the feeling of strong winds battering your skin.\n\nLooking around, there's nothing left. The arid scent of the desert air fills your nostrils, as it always has, but now you can also smell something new: oil and blood. Broken machinery, remnants of houses, and corpses. Your friends, companions... All dead.\n\nRummaging through the wreckage of your former home, you find that the storm either swept away or destroyed almost everything. Calling for help is pointless. It seems you're on your own. As hope fades, the flap of an object in the wind catches your eye. Sandy brown, much like most things around these parts.\n\nLeather... A rucksack! Good. You can use this to carry whatever you find. You have a talent for finding useful parts, and quickly stash away anything that looks workable, as well as the few meagre supplies that remain.\n\n[Press WASD to move and E to interact with locations of interest.
